Adding a custom domain to your github hosted website is a neat trick. You can simply purchase a domain and still have your website
hosted with github which takes a huge load off of my mind. Plus it is just easier to do a git push and be done with things.

## New IP Addresses

Github has some new ip address that you will need to point your website to in order for it to work.

The old ip address were:

A @ 192.30.252.153
A @ 192.30.252.154

The new ips should be
A @ 185.199.108.153
A @ 185.199.109.153
A @ 185.199.110.153
A @ 185.199.111.153

I will be creating a step by step guide on how to set this up but for now I just wanted to document the changes.
